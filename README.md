# Franco SÃ¡nchez ðŸš€

Passionate software developer eager to explore new technologies and continuously learn new skills.

My personal interest is focused on frontend development; however, with the experience I've gained in my first year as a developer, I've also been involved in full-stack development, thanks to my current position.

One of my goals is to create high-quality, scalable software that can make people's lives a little easier.
